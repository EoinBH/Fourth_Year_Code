This folder contains a pdf file of my Final Year Project report, 'Final_Year_Project_Final_Report.pdf'. There is also a subdirectory, 'App', containing the code I wrote for my Final Year Project. The code for the DynamicEM algorithm written by Dr. Martin Emms and Dr. Arun Jayapal is also contained therein since my Final Year Project utilised it. Furthermore, corpora of real observed data is stored in the subdirectory 'App/NgramSubCorpora'. This is some Google n-gram data compiled by Michel, J.-B., Shen, Y. K., Aiden, A. P., Veres, A., Gray, M. K., Team, T. G. B., Pickett, J. P., Hoiberg, D., Clancy, D., Norvig, P., Orwant, J., Pinker, S., Nowak, M. A., and Aiden, E. L. (2011). Quantitative analysis of culture using millions of digitized books. Science, 331(6014):176â€“182.

There is a README.txt in the 'App' subdirectory with more details.
