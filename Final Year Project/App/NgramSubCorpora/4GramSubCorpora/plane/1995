social and moral plane 1995 2 2 
some are plane , 1995 1 1 
Some of the plane 1995 3 3

Soviet fighter plane . 1995 5 5 
social plane , we 1995 7 6 
social plane and the 1995 3 3 
so that plane strain 1995 1 1 
some higher plane . 1995 3 3 
some other plane , 1995 4 4 
solid , plane , 1995 4 4 
social plane to the 1995 2 2 
socio - cultural plane 1995 3 2 
so in the plane 1995 2 2 
so the film plane 1995 1 1 
so the plane is 1995 1 1 
something on the plane 1995 7 7 
social plane on which 1995 1 1 
source in a plane 1995 5 5 
So on the plane 1995 1 1 
Soviet plane . _END_ 1995 5 5

soon the plane was 1995 1 1 
some other plane . 1995 13 11 
so is the plane 1995 5 5 
source into a plane 1995 1 1 
so with the plane 1995 1 1 
some higher plane , 1995 7 7 
so that each plane 1995 1 1

Soon , the plane 1995 2 2 
something in the plane 1995 8 6 
some imaginative plane out 1995 3 3 
source is a plane 1995 2 2 
some other plane or 1995 2 2

so the plane can 1995 7 7 
solid with a plane 1995 3 3 
some inclined plane of 1995 1 1 
some plane , and 1995 1 1 
South African Airways plane 1995 3 3 
some kind of plane 1995 1 1 
some reference plane , 1995 1 1 
social plane ; _END_ 1995 4 4 
sole of a plane 1995 1 1 
somewhat above the plane 1995 4 4 
social plane ? _END_ 1995 1 1 
so that one plane 1995 3 2 
sold the plane to 1995 4 4 
something about a plane 1995 6 6 
something like a plane 1995 1 1 
so in a plane 1995 1 1 
solution to the plane 1995 1 1 
solution of a plane 1995 1 1 
soon as my plane 1995 3 3 
south plane , the 1995 1 1 
so the plane had 1995 3 3 
so , a plane 1995 2 2 
soon after the plane 1995 5 5 
sounded like a plane 1995 4 4 
so exalted a plane 1995 5 5 
some plane which is 1995 1 1 
so that plane of 1995 1 1 
social plane , in 1995 3 3 
social plane with the 1995 2 2 
Something about the plane 1995 4 4 
so if the plane 1995 3 3 
solution of plane stress 1995 1 1 
sources in a plane 1995 1 1 
solution is a plane 1995 3 2 
Solution of plane elasticity 1995 1 1 
so on the plane 1995 1 1 
so that any plane 1995 2 2 
so that every plane 1995 1 1 
South Korean passenger plane 1995 5 4 
solid bounded by plane 1995 1 1 
some arbitrary reference plane 1995 1 1 
so when the plane 1995 2 2 
some plane tickets . 1995 3 3 
soon as our plane 1995 2 2 
some cases the plane 1995 1 1 
some plane . _END_ 1995 8 8 
social plane . _END_ 1995 54 46 
social plane , the 1995 13 13 
someone on a plane 1995 4 4

source plane . _END_ 1995 35 12 
soaring plane . _END_ 1995 4 3 
somewhat different plane , 1995 2 2 
so that plane waves 1995 2 2 
source on the plane 1995 4 4 
some in - plane 1995 4 3 
some plane in the 1995 1 1 
so the plane would 1995 4 4 
sounds like a plane 1995 1 1

So the plane had 1995 1 1 
sounds of the plane 1995 2 2 
some of the plane 1995 5 5 
sort of a plane 1995 1 1
