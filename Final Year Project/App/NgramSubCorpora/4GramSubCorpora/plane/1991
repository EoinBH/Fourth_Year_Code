someone on the plane 1991 4 4 
solution rotates the plane 1991 2 2 
something to the plane 1991 3 3 
soon as that plane 1991 1 1 
some higher plane of 1991 11 10

something in the plane 1991 1 1 
some imaginative plane out 1991 4 1 
somewhat from the plane 1991 1 1 
source is a plane 1991 2 2 
some other plane or 1991 1 1 
somewhat different plane from 1991 4 4 
source to the plane 1991 1 1 
social plane , that 1991 3 3 
source at the plane 1991 2 2 
some distant plane . 1991 2 2 
social plane and in 1991 1 1 
somewhere in the plane 1991 7 7 
social plane , where 1991 1 1

social plane , but 1991 3 3 
source and the plane 1991 2 2 
so the plane can 1991 4 4 
solid with a plane 1991 4 4 
some plane , and 1991 1 1 
South African Airways plane 1991 3 3 
some kind of plane 1991 1 1

social plane , a 1991 1 1 
sole of a plane 1991 1 1 
social plane ? _END_ 1991 1 1 
so that one plane 1991 1 1 
sold the plane to 1991 6 6 
something about a plane 1991 4 4 
so in a plane 1991 1 1 
solution to the plane 1991 3 3 
solution of a plane 1991 5 5 
soon as my plane 1991 2 2 
Soon the plane would 1991 10 10 
so the plane had 1991 1 1 
so , a plane 1991 1 1 
sometimes in the plane 1991 2 2 
soon after the plane 1991 3 3 
soared above the plane 1991 1 1 
source , the plane 1991 1 1 
sounded like a plane 1991 4 4 
so that plane of 1991 3 1 
social plane , in 1991 1 1 
solar equatorial plane and 1991 6 6 
solution of plane stress 1991 1 1 
sources in a plane 1991 3 3 
so did the plane 1991 3 3 
something on a plane 1991 2 2 
solution is a plane 1991 2 2 
social plane than the 1991 1 1 
solids and plane figures 1991 2 2 
so on the plane 1991 6 6 
so that any plane 1991 3 3 
South Korean passenger plane 1991 2 2

some arbitrary reference plane 1991 2 2 
so when the plane 1991 2 2
