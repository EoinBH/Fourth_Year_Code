solution of a plane 2005 2 2 
soon as my plane 2005 7 7 
south plane , the 2005 1 1 
so the plane had 2005 4 4 
so on a plane 2005 1 1 
some fine plane - 2005 2 2 
so , a plane 2005 1 1 
sometimes in the plane 2005 2 2 
soon after the plane 2005 8 8 
soared above the plane 2005 2 2 
source , the plane 2005 2 2 
sounded like a plane 2005 6 6 
sound , the plane 2005 3 3 
some plane which is 2005 1 1 
social plane , in 2005 2 2 
so near the plane 2005 1 1 
social plane with the 2005 3 3 
Something about the plane 2005 3 3 
so if the plane 2005 4 4 
solar equatorial plane and 2005 1 1 
solution of plane stress 2005 4 4 
sources in a plane 2005 4 4 
so did the plane 2005 3 3 
something on a plane 2005 3 3 
solution is a plane 2005 2 2 
social plane than the 2005 5 5 
so on the plane 2005 4 4 
so that any plane 2005 6 4 
South Korean passenger plane 2005 6 6 
solid bounded by plane 2005 3 3 
so when the plane 2005 11 11 
some plane tickets . 2005 7 7 
soon as our plane 2005 7 7 
some cases the plane 2005 1 1 
social plane , this 2005 4 4 
some plane . _END_ 2005 11 11 
social plane . _END_ 2005 63 60 
social plane , the 2005 17 16 
someone on a plane 2005 15 15 
social plane , or 2005 1 1 
soon as his plane 2005 13 11 
source plane . _END_ 2005 38 19 
soaring plane . _END_ 2005 2 2 
sociological plane . _END_ 2005 2 2 
somewhat different plane , 2005 1 1 
some plane perpendicular to 2005 1 1 
some in - plane 2005 6 6 
some plane in the 2005 3 3 
some plane of weakness 2005 4 2 
so the plane would 2005 4 4 
sounds like a plane 2005 1 1 
somewhat lower plane . 2005 1 1 
So the plane had 2005 2 2 
some plane or other 2005 1 1 
sounds of the plane 2005 5 5 
some of the plane 2005 16 16 
sort of a plane 2005 4 4 
source plane , the 2005 3 3 
some plane - trees 2005 1 1 
source plane to the 2005 4 4 
solution for a plane 2005 8 8 
so - called plane 2005 17 14 
so , the plane 2005 11 11 
somebody on the plane 2005 3 3 
yet higher plane . 2005 1 1 
yet another plane , 2005 13 13 
Yes , the plane 2005 8 8 
yet reached the plane 2005 1 1 
year -- old plane 2005 3 3 
yet higher plane of 2005 2 2 
year - old plane 2005 14 13

years above the plane 2005 1 1 
year in a plane 2005 2 2 
year , the plane 2005 6 5 
yes , the plane 2005 1 1 
years before the plane 2005 4 4 
yet another plane . 2005 4 4 
yet a third plane 2005 5 5 
years the plane of 2005 2 2 
yellow plane . _END_ 2005 6 5
