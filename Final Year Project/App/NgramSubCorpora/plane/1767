plane to its height . 1767 2 2 
plane of the orbit in 1767 1 1 
plane is perpendicular to the 1767 2 2 
plane of the dial is 1767 2 2 
plane in a right line 1767 1 1 
plane is equal to the 1767 1 1 
plane of the ecliptic in 1767 2 2 
plane , as it is 1767 2 2

plane of the board , 1767 4 2 
plane of the orbit with 1767 1 1 
plane coincides with the plane 1767 2 2
