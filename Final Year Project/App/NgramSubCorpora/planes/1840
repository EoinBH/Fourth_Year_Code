planes of these circles are 1840 1 1 
planes , since it is 1840 1 1

planes of projection can be 1840 1 1

planes to each other is 1840 1 1

planes of projection ; _END_ 1840 3 2 
planes is tangent to the 1840 2 2

planes perpendicular to their axes 1840 3 3 
planes that can be drawn 1840 1 1 
planes can be drawn through 1840 2 1 
planes which compose the bottom 1840 1 1
