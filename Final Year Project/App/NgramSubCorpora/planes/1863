planes , that is , 1863 1 1 
planes , more or less 1863 2 2 
planes of section of the 1863 2 2 
planes will be parallel to 1863 2 2 
planes ( for example , 1863 1 1 
planes of the mirrors . 1863 1 1 
planes , while the other 1863 1 1 
planes which are inclined at 1863 3 3 
planes is equivalent to a 1863 1 1

planes inclined to each other 1863 2 2 
planes of projection are used 1863 1 1
